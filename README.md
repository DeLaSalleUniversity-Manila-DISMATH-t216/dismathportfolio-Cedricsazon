#Week 1 
- I thought it would just be an ordinary orientation day of the course but before dismissal the class was presented with two questions about Knight and Knaves which gave our mind a fun challenge of our logic.
- After the orientation, I was pretty sure that this course is going to be challenging
- I also realized that you really have to use you head and you have to think alot in this subject.

#Week 2
- First day of lessons, I was very excited as to what the course has prepared for the class
- A proposition is a statement that is either true(1) or false(0)
- Logical deduction is a process of reasoning from one ore more statements (premises) to reach a logically certain conclusion
- In order to understand Discrete Math, I had to study the Logical Connectives which was very new to me 
- Logical Connectives
    - Negation (¬, not)
    - Conjunction (∧, and)
    - Disjunction (∨, or)
    - Exclusive Or (⊕, xor)
    - Conditional (→, if,then)
    - Biconditional (↔, iff)
-  And then, the all powerful Truth Table, lists the possible combinations of the input with their corresponding output
-  Logical Equivalences was also discussed 
    - Identity Law
    - Domination Law
    - Negation Law
    - Double Negation Law
    - Idempotent Law
    - Commutative Law
    - Associative Law
    - Distributive Law
    - De Morgan's Law
    - Absorption Law
 - Rules of Inference (terminologies)
    - argument is a sequence of statements that end with a question
    - valid is the conclusion or final statment of the argument, must follow from the truth of the preceding statements, or premises, of the argument
    - fallacy is common form of incorrect reasoning which lead to invalud arguments
    - tautology is a statement that is always true
    * Modus Ponens
    * Modus Tollens
    * Hypothetical syllogism
    * Disjunctive syllogism
    * Addition
    * Simplification
    * Conjuction
    * Resolution
- Implication Equivalence: p→q = ¬p∨q
- At the end of the week, I observed that after every class I feel mentally exhausted
- However, the fun part was an assignment proving that Superman does not exist (logically)

#Week 3
- 4 methods of Proof:
    - Direct Proof
    - Proof by Contraposition (Indirect)
    - Proof by Contradiction (Indirect)
    - Proof by Equivalence 

- Direct Proof:
    - First, we assume P is true.
    - Then, we show that q is also true.
    
- Proof by Contraposition:
    - First, we assume ¬q is true.
    - Then, we show that ¬p is true.
    
- Proof by Contradiction:
    - First assume ¬p is true.
    - Then, show that ¬q is true.
    
- Vacaous and Trivial Proof:
    - For Vacuous Proof, p is false because p→q must be true when p is false.
    - For Trivial Proof, q is true, it follows that p→q must also be true.

#Week 4
- Proof by Equivalence:
    - p→q and q→p are both true.

- Mathematical Induction:
    - Basis Step
    - Inductive Step
